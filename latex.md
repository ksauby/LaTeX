# On Using LaTeX


## To write LaTeX documents, use R Markdown

In many ways, R Markdown is much easier to use than LaTeX directly.

### Pros:
- code is less distracting
- can still include equations
- can still create a bibliography from a .bib file
- creating a Word document (to send to collaborators!) is easier with R Markdown, especially on Mac
### Cons:
- Tables are harder to format, especially if your output is a Word document

Note - you'll still need to download LaTeX first.

## Equations

I often use an online website to write my equations: https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php

## Online LaTeX Editors

I haven't personally used these.
